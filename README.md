# cpp-dict
A dictionary of cpp keyword/function. You can set path to this file in vim to get some help in auto-completion.

I know I can use some plugin to do same work but I don't like bloating vim at all.

Installation:
Just add this file to your vimrc as:

```
set dictionary=$HOME/cpp-keyword-dictionary/cpp-words
```

__change file location if you didn't cloned this repo in you home directory__
