# cpp-dict
A dictionary of cpp keyword/function. You can set path to this file in vim to get some help in auto-completion.

I know I can use some plugin to do same work but I don't like bloating vim at all.

Installation:
Just add this file to your vimrc as:

```
set dictionary=file-location-on-your-system/cpp-words
```

click [here](https://github.com/offamitkumar/dot_files/blob/5bcc08d5271aa9f544c023ced5ac3e2068f1e0dd/.vimrc#L6) to see my config.

__change file location if you didn't cloned this repo in you home directory__
